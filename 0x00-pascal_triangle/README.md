Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known in many cultures long before his time. It's constructed by starting with a 1 at the top, then adding pairs of numbers below to form the numbers in the rows below. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle starts:

```
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
```

And it continues infinitely. It has a plethora of interesting properties and applications in various areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, algebra, probability theory, and number theory. For instance, the coefficients in the expansion of binomials (a + b)^n correspond to the nth row of Pascal's Triangle. It's also used in various fields like computer science and physics.
